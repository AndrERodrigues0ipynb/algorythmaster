Hello all

I am learning Python and in the control flow chapter i am practising using the while funcion
In this exercise i want to create a loop within a loop and the desired output is
Hello I am here to help
Hello I am here to help
Hello I am here to help
Hello I am here to help
Hello I am here to help

Code (using jupyter)

i=1
while i <= 5:
    print("Hello ")
    j = 1
    while j <= 4:
        print("I am here to help ")
        j = j + 1

        
    i = i + 1
    
    However when i run my code the output is 
   Hello 
I am here to help 
I am here to help 
I am here to help 
I am here to help 
Hello 
I am here to help 
I am here to help 
I am here to help 
I am here to help 
Hello 
I am here to help 
I am here to help 
I am here to help 
I am here to help 
Hello 
I am here to help 
I am here to help 
I am here to help 
I am here to help 
Hello 
I am here to help 
I am here to help 
I am here to help 
I am here to help 

What is missing in my file so that i can reach the output in the beginning?

Thank you all
